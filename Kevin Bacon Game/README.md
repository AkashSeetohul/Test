A program written for my Object-Oriented Programming class which reads a directory, then builds a graph with actors as vertices and edges signifying acquaintanceships. The program uses breadth-first search to find and backtracks the shortest path (connection) between different actors with Kevin Bacon as center, and codes more functionality such as average paths.
